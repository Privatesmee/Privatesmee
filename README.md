ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Privatesmee

I'm currently new to development and am trying to find a direction in my career.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in looking at creating desktop apps at the moment though I have no idea what at the moment.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python but I am also now looking to learn Javascript, CSS and more about HTML.
